# Network Communication Experiments
Repository for experimental software, statistical analysis, computational modeling, and behavioral data used in ongoing network experiments on group communication. This README.md provides a roadmap for the software and data stored in this repository. Directories will have additional README.md files to help with using the software. Please consult the following publications for additional information on these experiments and findings.

### Network Experiment Software 
This directory contains the Python (OTree) and JavaScript software for running a network experiment on group communication. There are two folders, face_experiment and hashtag_experiment, which ask participants to communicate and align responses using different digital media. The README.md in this directory provides instructions for setting up a server to host the experiment, which you can customize and extend with minimal Python and JavaScript expertise. Below is a high-level overview of the experimental procedure
