# Network Communication Experiments

Repository for experimental software, statistical analysis, and behavioral data used in ongoing network experiments on group communication. 


### Network Experiment Software 

This directory contains the Python (OTree) and JavaScript software for running a network experiment on group communication. There are two folders, face_experiment and hashtag_experiment, which ask participants to communicate and align responses using different digital media. The README.md in this directory provides instructions for setting up a server to host the experiment, which you can customize and extend with minimal Python and JavaScript expertise.
